# t - the smart tmux session manager

tmux is a powerful tool, but dealing with sessions can be painful. This script makes it easy to create and switch tmux sessions:

## Prerequisites

- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)
- [tpm](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm)
- [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide)
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) (>=0.35.0)
- [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) (optional)

## How to install

### 1. Install tpm plugin

Add the following line to your `tmux.conf` file:

```sh
set -g @plugin 'joshmedeski/t-smart-tmux-session-manager'
```

**Note:** tpm recommends you list your plugins and then run tpm at the very bottom of your `tmux.conf`.

Then, run `<prefix>I` to install the plugin.

### 2. Add to path

To use the `t` script from anywhere, select your shell environment and follow the instructions.

**Note:** you'll need to check the path of your tpm plugins. It may be `~/.tmux/plugins` or `~/.config/tmux/plugins` depending on where your `tmux.conf` is located.

<details>
<summary>bash</summary>

Add the following line to `~/.bashrc`

```sh
# ~/.tmux/plugins
export PATH=$HOME/.tmux/plugins/t-smart-tmux-session-manager/bin:$PATH
# ~/.config/tmux/plugins
export PATH=$HOME/.config/tmux/plugins/t-smart-tmux-session-manager/bin:$PATH
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>zsh</summary>

Add the following line to `~/.zprofile`

```sh
# ~/.tmux/plugins
export PATH=$HOME/.tmux/plugins/t-smart-tmux-session-manager/bin:$PATH
# ~/.config/tmux/plugins
export PATH=$HOME/.config/tmux/plugins/t-smart-tmux-session-manager/bin:$PATH
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>fish</summary>

Add the following line to `~/.config/fish/config.fish`

```fish
# ~/.tmux/plugins
fish_add_path $HOME/.tmux/plugins/t-smart-tmux-session-manager/bin
# ~/.config/tmux/plugins
fish_add_path $HOME/.config/tmux/plugins/t-smart-tmux-session-manager/bin
```

</details>

### 3. Recommended tmux settings

I recommend you add these settings to your `tmux.conf` to have a better experience with this plugin.

```sh
bind-key x kill-pane # skip "kill-pane 1? (y/n)" prompt
set -g detach-on-destroy off  # don't exit from tmux when closing a session
```

## Configuration (optional)

### 1. Customize Prompt

If your terminal supports [Nerd Font symbols](https://www.nerdfonts.com/), you can customize your prompt.

```sh
set -g @t-fzf-prompt 'î¯ˆ  '
```

Or you can replace the prompt with anything you'd like.

### 2. Set a custom keybindings

In order to add your own custom key binding to trigger the `t` script, add the following to your `tmux.conf`:

```sh
set -g @t-bind "J"
```

You can unbind the default by entering an unmappable string (e.g. `none`)

### 3. Set the empty session creation option

When running the script inside tmux you may want to crete an empty session when your query doesn't match any, to do so add the following to your `tmux.conf`:

```sh
set -g @t-new-session-on-empty "on"
```

## How to use

```sh
  Run interactive mode
      t
        ctrl-s list only tmux sessions
        ctrl-x list only zoxide results
        ctrl-d list directories

  Go to session (matches tmux session, zoxide result, or directory)
      t {name}

  Open popup (while in tmux)
      <prefix>+T
        ctrl-s list only tmux sessions
        ctrl-x list only zoxide results
        ctrl-d list directories

  Show help
      t -h
      t --help
```

By default, this plugin is bound to `<prefix>+T` which triggers a fzf-tmux popup that display zoxide results. Type the result you want and when you hit enter it will create a tmux session and connect to it or, if the sessions already exists, switch to it.

If you are not in tmux, you can simply run `t` to start the interactive script, or call `t {name}` to jump directly to a session of your choosing.

### Key Bindings

- `ctrl-s` list only tmux sessions
- `ctrl-x` list only zoxide results
- `ctrl-d` list directories (or find if fd isn't installed)

## Bonus: macOS keyboard shortcut

My personal workflow uses [macOS Keyboard Shortcuts for tmux](https://www.joshmedeski.com/posts/macos-keyboard-shortcuts-for-tmux/). I have bound the `t` popup to `cmd+j` with the following code:

<details>
<summary>Alacritty</summary>

Add the following line to your `alacritty.yml`

```yml
key_bindings:
  - { key: J, mods: Command, chars: "\x02\x54" } # open t - tmux smart session manager
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Kitty</summary>

Add the following line to your `kitty.conf`

```sh
map cmd+j send_text all \x02\x54
```

</details>

**Note:** These bindings are based off the default prefix, `ctrl+b` (which converts to `\x02`). If you changed your prefix, I recommend [watching my video](https://www.joshmedeski.com/posts/macos-keyboard-shortcuts-for-tmux/) which goes into depth how to customize your own keybindings in Alacritty.
